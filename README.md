The most successful international company I think is HUAWEI Technologies. Why would I choose it? According to my research, It has been keeping high speed growth since 2006. In 2006, It’s contract sales had reached USD11 billion and net profit of USD600 million. 65% of the contract sales came from the international market which had became the major driver of sales growth. In 2017, given by report, it's annual revenue was over USD92 billion and net profit up to USD8000+ million. The overseas income accounted for 50%, this number has dropped compare with 2006, but consider it’s total income had increased by 10 times during 12 years. It is also a considerable amount of portion. Based on the above figures, no doubt, HUAWEI Technologies is a global enterprise in china. Besides, the most important reason why I have this choice, fortunately, is that I had been worked in it as a software engineer for 2 years after I graduated from University. I am very proud of it. I will give my view from the following aspects.

Dedicated

HUAWEI Technologies was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei in SZ,, It has been 30 years since its establishment. At the beginning, Mr Ren started his business in agent way by selling telephone exchange switches which came from HK . Chinese government urged to improve the country's underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure. while almost all of the Communication equipment were imported from abroad and most advanced technologies were under control by foreign company. After then, He saw the potential massive market in telecommunications industry and decided to develop the switches through recruiting local researcher and tried to break technical barriers.

Persistent
During the development in the past 30 years, HUAWEI Technologies has been dedicated to the main navigation channel(core business, It is a dedicated noun by Mr Ren), It always focus on telecommunications areas and is not influenced by any other fields which have nothing relation to communications .In 1998, HUAWEI Technologies aimed at 3G mobile market in the future and invested heavily in research and development, one-third of developers were engaged in this direction, billions of RMB were involved in this project. A few years later, unfortunately,  the release of the 3G licenses had been delayed by the Chinese government until 2008. HUAWEI had to give more attentions to international market to seek to survive. Nowadays, it occupies the biggest global market share in wireless communication field. This remarkable achievement is derived from persistence of all years.

Vision
Today, HUAWEI’s vision and mission is to bring digital to every person, home and organization for a fully connected, intelligent world. But a decade ago, instead, it was the vision to enrich life through communication. Frankly speak, I appreciate the former vision because it is short,brief and easy to remember. 

Culture
The culture of HUAWEI has much distinctive characteristic, the most significant of these is struggle. HUAWEI emphasizes that the only way to obtain accomplishments is through hard work. According to investigation. The amount of work time in HUAWEI is far more than those of other companies in china. But HUAWEI is not a company like others which always stress dedication but don’t mention any return. It can not guarantee absolute fairness, however, a major employees deserve a reasonable and rich reward. The average pay was up to RMB700 thousand in 2017
